# Drink-Water-Visualizer
A  visualization of your **daily goal of drinking water.** <br><br>
When you click on an empty cup it will fill up indiccating you drank a cup of water and it will be added towards your goal of driking water for the day. <br><br>
When a cup is clicked, the total volume in the big cup will animate and will start filling in partially showing what your current progess is in percentage form.
A you keep adding cups the total volume in the bifg cup will start increasing until it gets full. <br><br>
And when you click on a cup that is currently full, it will become empty and the total volume will decrease along with the total percentage of your goal. <br><br>
The demo is live at *https://therealrajan.github.io/Drink-Water-Visualizer/* <br><br>
Any improvements are welcome.
